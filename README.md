# FRC-2015
Team 1829's robot code for Recycle Rush.  We've put off naming the robot for too long so I'm going to call it Black Electric.  If anybody has a problem with that talk to Nick.

## Overview
Our code this year started with the nice foundation of our team library (https://github.com/Carbonauts/CarbonLibrary) that we built last year, and as the season progressed we made updates to the library to make our abstraction more tactical.  The robot code itself used a command style hierarchy, placing motor- and sensor-wrapping code in Subsystem files and action-oriented code in Command files.

Each package will have its own Readme.md so that more detail can be given while explaining the intent and implementation of particular pieces of code without creating a rediculous wall of text on the main page.  Links to these subsequent docs are posted below.
