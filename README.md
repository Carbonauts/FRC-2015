# FRC-2015
Team 1829's robot code for Recycle Rush.  We've put off naming the robot for too long so I'm going to call it Black Electric.  If anybody has a problem with that talk to Nick.

## Overview
Our code this year started with the nice foundation of our team library (https://github.com/Carbonauts/CarbonLibrary) that we built last year, and as the season progressed we made updates to the library to make our abstraction more tactical.  The robot code itself used a command style hierarchy, placing motor- and sensor-wrapping code in Subsystem files and action-oriented code in Command files.

The wiki (over at https://github.com/Carbonauts/FRC-2015/wiki) contains more detailed explanations of intentions behind particular pieces of code or descriptions of different standards held that will help to bring new readers into the mindset that was used while writing the code.
